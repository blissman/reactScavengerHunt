# React Scavenger Hunt

React Scavenger Hunt is used for serving unique photos based on the user's location. You can use it to create a scavenger hunt, or to provide a photo tour through a city.

## How it Works

This app takes your detected location and converts the latitude and longitude to a word combination using the what3words api, then returns an image from the unsplash api.

## Pre-requisites

### APIs

#### what3words

You'll need an api key from [what3words](https://www.what3words.com) in order to convert your geolocation to a word combination.

#### unsplash

You'll also need an api key from [unsplash](https://www.unsplash.com) in order to fetch images.

## Setup

### Set up your API keys

Create a file named ```apiConfig.js``` inside the ```src/config``` folder, using the ```apiConfigTemplate.js``` as a template. Fill in your API keys respectively as strings.

### Testing the App

Start your server using ```$ npm start``` and allow your browser to detect your location. The unique image of your location should appear!

## Using the App

Navigate to the page, click on the button, and get the image for your location!

=====

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
